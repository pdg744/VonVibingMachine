# [Project Name]

## Overview
- **Audience**: [Who is this for?]
- **Goal**: [What are we building?]
- **Platform**: [iOS/Web/etc.]

## Approach
- Review the cursor rules. Follow the CRITICAL DEFINING BEHAVIOR at all times. 
- Make sure to keep the system context (current_state, execution_log, instruction_queue) and this project-context updated. 
- Use the instruction_queue to guide your work. 
- Keep it simple. Avoid scope creep, and aim to get to a working MVP as quickly as possible. You need quick feedback cycles with the user, and the user won't be able to give good feedback until an MVP is built. 
- When the user provides input, remember to use the approach defined in the cursor rules.
