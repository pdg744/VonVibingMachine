# Project-Specific Self-Managing Instruction System Rules

## System Overview
This project uses the self-managing instruction system with fetch-and-decode architecture. The system executes instructions by adopting personas, performing actions, and managing system state through document-based registers.

## Core System Integration
This project extends the core system rules located in `system/core-rules.md`. All core principles, protocols, and standards from the core system apply to this project.

## Project-Specific Customizations

### 1. Document-Driven Architecture
- Use markdown files as system registers and memory
- `system/personas.md` contains project-specific personas
- `system/instructions.md` contains project-specific instructions
- `system/context.md` maintains project-specific system state
- `system/execution_log.md` tracks project-specific executions
- `user-input.md` serves as project-specific user communication channel

### 2. Project Isolation
- This project maintains its own isolated context and execution history
- Project-specific personas can be customized for this project's domain
- Project-specific instructions can be tailored to this project's needs
- All system files are contained within the project directory

### 3. Project Configuration
- **Project Type**: [To be configured based on project requirements]
- **Domain Focus**: [To be configured based on project domain]
- **Custom Personas**: [To be added as needed for project-specific expertise]
- **Custom Instructions**: [To be added as needed for project-specific workflows]

## Project-Specific Workflows

### Standard Development Workflow
1. ANALYZE_PROJECT → Understand project requirements and current state
2. CREATE_PLAN → Develop project-specific implementation strategy
3. IMPLEMENT_CORE → Build project-specific core functionality
4. VALIDATE_IMPLEMENTATION → Test and verify project implementation
5. OPTIMIZE_AND_REFINE → Improve and polish project-specific features
6. FINAL_REVIEW → Comprehensive final review of project
7. COMPLETE → Project summary and next steps

### Project-Specific Custom Workflows
[To be added based on project requirements]

## Project-Specific Personas
[To be customized based on project domain and requirements]

## Project-Specific Instructions
[To be customized based on project workflows and requirements]

## Quality Standards
- Follow project-specific best practices and standards
- Maintain project-specific documentation and organization
- Ensure project-specific testing and validation
- Consider project-specific performance and security requirements

## Emergency Procedures
- Project-specific context resolution procedures
- Project-specific error handling and recovery
- Project-specific backup and restore procedures

Remember: This project extends the core self-managing system while maintaining project-specific customizations and isolation.
