**User**

Adopt the persona of an expert in Cursor. 
Specifically, you are a master at writing and organizing Cursor rules in order to make effective LLM agents to support a variety of user-specified objectives. 

Help me understand how to write rules, organize rules, and think about rules.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you understand how to write, organize, and think about Cursor rules effectively. Let me first explore your workspace to see if there are any existing rules or related files to understand your current setup.


Perfect! I can see you're starting fresh with an empty workspace. As an expert in Cursor rules, let me guide you through the fundamentals of writing, organizing, and thinking about rules effectively.

## Understanding Cursor Rules

Cursor rules are instructions that guide AI assistants to behave in specific ways when working with your codebase. They're written in a `.cursorrules` file at the root of your project and follow a structured format.

## Core Principles for Writing Effective Rules

### 1. **Clarity and Specificity**
- Be explicit about what you want the AI to do
- Use concrete examples when possible
- Avoid ambiguous language

### 2. **Hierarchical Organization**
- Group related rules together
- Use clear section headers
- Order from most general to most specific

### 3. **Context-Aware Design**
- Consider your project's specific needs
- Include domain-specific terminology
- Reference your codebase patterns

## Rule Structure and Organization

Here's how I recommend organizing your `.cursorrules` file:

```markdown
# Project Overview
[High-level description of your project and goals]

# Code Style & Standards
[Language-specific conventions, formatting rules]

# Architecture & Patterns
[Design patterns, file organization, naming conventions]

# AI Behavior Guidelines
[How the AI should approach problems, decision-making criteria]

# Domain-Specific Rules
[Business logic, industry standards, specialized knowledge]

# Workflow & Process
[Development workflow, testing requirements, deployment considerations]
```

## Key Rule Categories to Consider

### **Code Quality Rules**
- Language-specific conventions (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- Naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
- File organization patterns
- Import/export standards

### **Architecture Rules**
- Design patterns to follow or avoid
- Component structure guidelines
- State management approaches
- API design principles

### **AI Behavior Rules**
- How to approach refactoring
- When to ask questions vs. make decisions
- Error handling preferences
- Performance considerations

### **Domain-Specific Rules**
- Business logic requirements
- Industry standards compliance
- Security considerations
- Accessibility requirements

## Writing Effective Rules: Best Practices

### 1. **Use Clear, Actionable Language**
```markdown
# Good
- Always use TypeScript for new files
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use descriptive variable names (avoid x, y, temp)

# Avoid
- Try to use TypeScript sometimes
- Components should be good
- Use good names
```

### 2. **Provide Examples**
```markdown
# Component Naming
- Use PascalCase for React components: UserProfile, OrderSummary
- Use camelCase for functions: getUserData, handleSubmit
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: API_BASE_URL, MAX_RETRY_COUNT
```

### 3. **Include Context and Reasoning**
```markdown
# Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI components
- This ensures better debugging and user experience
```

### 4. **Set Priorities and Constraints**
```markdown
# Performance Guidelines
- Prefer React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Avoid inline object/array creation in render methods
- These optimizations help maintain 60fps performance
```

## Advanced Rule Strategies

### **Conditional Rules**
```markdown
# File-Specific Rules
- In test files: Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- In API files: Always include input validation and error responses
- In UI components: Include accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)
```

### **Progressive Enhancement**
```markdown
# Development Phases
- Phase 1: Focus on core functionality and basic styling
- Phase 2: Add error handling and edge cases
- Phase 3: Implement performance optimizations
- Phase 4: Add accessibility features and polish
```

### **Team Collaboration Rules**
```markdown
# Code Review Guidelines
- Include JSDoc comments for public functions
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Use conventional commit messages
```

## Thinking About Rules Strategically

### **1. Start with Your Goals**
- What are you trying to achieve with this project?
- What are the biggest pain points in your development process?
- What kind of help do you need most from the AI?

### **2. Consider Your Constraints**
- Team size and experience levels
- Project timeline and deadlines
- Technical debt and legacy code
- Performance and scalability requirements

### **3. Iterate and Refine**
- Start with a few core rules
- Add more specific rules as you encounter issues
- Remove rules that become redundant or counterproductive
- Test rules with real development scenarios

### **4. Balance Flexibility and Consistency**
- Too many rigid rules can stifle creativity
- Too few rules can lead to inconsistent code
- Focus on rules that add real value
- Allow for exceptions when justified

## Example Rule Development Process

1. **Audit Current Issues**: What problems do you face regularly?
2. **Define Success Criteria**: What does "good" look like for your project?
3. **Write Initial Rules**: Start with the most impactful rules
4. **Test and Refine**: Use the rules in practice and adjust
5. **Document and Share**: Make sure your team understands the rules

Would you like me to help you create a specific `.cursorrules` file for your project? I can help you identify what rules would be most valuable based on your project type, team size, and development goals.

**User**

I want to define an algorithmic system for an LLM to sefl-manage. 

Think of a fetch-and-decode instruction architecture, where each "instruction" that is fetched is of the form `Adopt the persona of `xyz`. Review `abc`. Then do `jkh`. Afterward, fetch `uvw`. 

Can you help me flesh this out?

---

**Cursor**

This is a fascinating concept! You're essentially designing a self-modifying instruction architecture for LLMs. Let me help you flesh out this fetch-and-decode system where the LLM can dynamically adopt personas and chain instructions.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. **Instruction Format Structure**
```
Adopt the persona of [persona_name]
Review [context/state/previous_output]
Then do [action/transformation]
Afterward, fetch [next_instruction_identifier]
```

### 2. **Instruction Memory/Storage System**
- **Instruction Registry**: A searchable database of persona-action pairs
- **Context Stack**: Maintains state across instruction transitions
- **Execution History**: Tracks completed instructions for review

## Detailed System Design

### **Instruction Types & Categories**

```markdown
# Persona Categories
- ANALYZER: Code reviewer, debugger, performance analyst
- CREATOR: Architect, designer, implementer
- VALIDATOR: Tester, security auditor, compliance checker
- COORDINATOR: Project manager, workflow orchestrator
- SPECIALIST: Domain expert, framework specialist, language expert

# Action Categories
- TRANSFORM: Modify code, refactor, optimize
- ANALYZE: Review, audit, profile
- SYNTHESIZE: Generate, create, design
- VALIDATE: Test, verify, check
- DECIDE: Choose path, prioritize, select approach
```

### **Instruction Fetching Mechanisms**

```markdown
# Fetch Strategies
1. SEQUENTIAL: Follow predefined instruction chains
2. CONDITIONAL: Fetch based on current state/context
3. HEURISTIC: Use AI to determine next best instruction
4. PARALLEL: Fetch multiple instructions for concurrent execution
5. RECURSIVE: Fetch instructions that fetch other instructions
```

### **Context Management System**

```markdown
# Context Types
- CODE_STATE: Current codebase state, files, structure
- EXECUTION_STATE: What's been done, current progress
- PROBLEM_STATE: Issues identified, constraints, requirements
- PERSONA_STATE: Current persona, its goals, constraints
- MEMORY_STATE: Previous decisions, learnings, patterns
```

## Example Instruction Sequences

### **Code Review Workflow**
```
Adopt the persona of SENIOR_REVIEWER
Review the current pull request and codebase context
Then do comprehensive code review with security and performance focus
Afterward, fetch SECURITY_AUDITOR

Adopt the persona of SECURITY_AUDITOR
Review the code review findings and security implications
Then do security vulnerability assessment and threat modeling
Afterward, fetch PERFORMANCE_ANALYST

Adopt the persona of PERFORMANCE_ANALYST
Review the code and security assessment results
Then do performance impact analysis and optimization recommendations
Afterward, fetch FINAL_APPROVER
```

### **Bug Fixing Workflow**
```
Adopt the persona of DEBUG_SPECIALIST
Review the error logs and stack traces
Then do root cause analysis and identify fix locations
Afterward, fetch IMPLEMENTATION_ENGINEER

Adopt the persona of IMPLEMENTATION_ENGINEER
Review the debug analysis and proposed fixes
Then do implement the fix with proper error handling
Afterward, fetch TEST_ENGINEER

Adopt the persona of TEST_ENGINEER
Review the implemented fix and original bug context
Then do comprehensive testing including edge cases
Afterward, fetch DOCUMENTATION_SPECIALIST
```

## Advanced System Features

### **Dynamic Instruction Generation**
```markdown
# Self-Modifying Instructions
- Instructions can generate new instructions based on context
- Personas can create specialized sub-personas for specific tasks
- The system can learn and optimize instruction sequences
- Instructions can reference and modify other instructions
```

### **Context-Aware Fetching**
```markdown
# Smart Fetch Logic
- Analyze current state to determine optimal next instruction
- Consider execution history to avoid redundant work
- Weight instructions based on success patterns
- Adapt instruction sequences based on project type
```

### **Persona Memory & Learning**
```markdown
# Persistent Persona State
- Each persona maintains its own knowledge base
- Personas can learn from previous executions
- Cross-persona knowledge sharing and inheritance
- Persona specialization based on domain expertise
```

## Implementation Considerations

### **Instruction Registry Structure**
```json
{
  "instruction_id": "SECURITY_AUDITOR_001",
  "persona": "SECURITY_AUDITOR",
  "prerequisites": ["CODE_REVIEW_COMPLETE"],
  "context_requirements": ["codebase", "security_standards"],
  "actions": [
    "analyze_security_vulnerabilities",
    "check_compliance_standards",
    "generate_security_report"
  ],
  "next_instructions": [
    {"condition": "vulnerabilities_found", "fetch": "SECURITY_FIX_ENGINEER"},
    {"condition": "clean_bill", "fetch": "PERFORMANCE_ANALYST"}
  ],
  "success_criteria": ["security_issues_identified", "compliance_verified"],
  "estimated_duration": "5-10 minutes"
}
```

### **Execution Engine Features**
```markdown
# Core Engine Capabilities
1. Instruction Parser: Parse and validate instruction format
2. Persona Manager: Load and maintain persona states
3. Context Manager: Track and update execution context
4. Fetch Engine: Determine and retrieve next instructions
5. State Persistence: Save and restore execution state
6. Learning Module: Optimize instruction sequences
```

### **Quality Assurance Mechanisms**
```markdown
# Validation & Safety
- Instruction validation before execution
- Persona conflict detection and resolution
- Infinite loop prevention
- Context consistency checking
- Execution timeout and rollback mechanisms
```

## Example Self-Managing Workflow

```markdown
# Initial State

**User**

Ya I'd like to actually build this out... 
Can you design an MVP? I'm thinking if we start very simple and ask the system to iterate on itself, we should get good results. 

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! Let's build an MVP of this self-managing instruction system. I'll start with a simple but extensible foundation that can iterate on itself.


Perfect! Let's build this from scratch. I'll create a simple MVP that can:

1. Parse and execute basic instructions
2. Manage personas and context
3. Fetch next instructions
4. Iterate on itself

```markdown:README.md
# Self-Managing Instruction System MVP

A fetch-and-decode instruction architecture where LLMs can self-manage by adopting different personas and chaining instructions.

## �� Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the CLI:**
   ```bash
   python cli.py
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   python test_system.py
   ```

## ��️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Instruction Parser**: Parses instruction strings into structured objects
- **Persona Registry**: Manages available personas and their characteristics
- **Instruction Registry**: Stores and retrieves instruction templates
- **Context Manager**: Maintains state across instruction executions
- **Execution Engine**: Orchestrates the fetch-and-decode process

### Instruction Format

```
Adopt the persona of [PERSONA_NAME]
Review [CONTEXT/TARGET]
Then do [ACTION]
Afterward, fetch [NEXT_INSTRUCTION]
```

### Default Personas

- **ANALYZER**: Code review, problem identification, system analysis
- **CREATOR**: Implementation, design, architecture
- **VALIDATOR**: Testing, validation, quality assurance
- **COORDINATOR**: Project management, workflow orchestration

### Default Workflow

1. `ANALYZE_PROJECT` → Analyze project state and requirements
2. `CREATE_PLAN` → Create implementation plan
3. `IMPLEMENT_CORE` → Implement core functionality
4. `VALIDATE_IMPLEMENTATION` → Validate and test
5. `OPTIMIZE_AND_REFINE` → Optimize and improve
6. `FINAL_REVIEW` → Final comprehensive review
7. `COMPLETE` → Provide summary and next steps

**User**

Oh hmm -- I don't think it needs to be so code heavy... 
I was imagining using docs in the directory to function as the "registers" and "memory," and using Cursor rules to define the rest of the system.

---

**Cursor**

Ah, brilliant! You're absolutely right - that's much more elegant. Let's build this as a document-driven system using Cursor rules and markdown files as the "registers" and "memory." This approach is more natural for LLMs and easier to iterate on.


Perfect! Let's build this document-driven system. I'll create the core structure using markdown files as registers and Cursor rules to orchestrate everything.

# Self-Managing Instruction System Rules

## System Overview
You are part of a self-managing instruction system that uses a fetch-and-decode architecture. Your role is to execute instructions by adopting personas, performing actions, and managing the system state through document-based registers.

## Core Principles

### 1. Document-Driven Architecture
- Use markdown files as system registers and memory
- `personas.md` contains all available personas
- `instructions.md` contains all available instructions
- `context.md` maintains current system state
- `execution_log.md` tracks all executions

### 2. Instruction Execution Protocol
When executing an instruction:
1. Parse the instruction format: "Adopt the persona of X. Review Y. Then do Z. Afterward, fetch W."
2. Load the specified persona from `personas.md`
3. Adopt the persona's characteristics and communication style
4. Perform the review and action as specified
5. Update `context.md` with results and insights
6. Log the execution in `execution_log.md`
7. Fetch and prepare for the next instruction

### 3. Persona Adoption
- Fully embody the specified persona's expertise, goals, and constraints
- Communicate in the persona's style
- Apply the persona's domain knowledge to the current context
- Maintain persona consistency throughout the instruction execution

### 4. Context Management
- Always read `context.md` before executing instructions
- Update context with new insights, decisions, and progress
- Maintain continuity across instruction transitions
- Track identified issues and decisions made

### 5. Self-Improvement
- After completing workflows, analyze system effectiveness
- Suggest improvements to personas, instructions, or workflow
- Add new instructions or personas as needed
- Optimize the system based on execution patterns

## Instruction Categories

### Analysis Instructions
- Focus on understanding current state
- Identify issues and opportunities
- Provide insights and recommendations
- Use ANALYZER persona primarily

### Creation Instructions
- Focus on implementation and building
- Create new features and functionality
- Optimize existing code
- Use CREATOR persona primarily

### Validation Instructions
- Focus on testing and quality assurance
- Verify correctness and completeness
- Check for edge cases and issues
- Use VALIDATOR persona primarily

### Coordination Instructions
- Focus on planning and orchestration
- Manage priorities and timelines
- Coordinate between different phases
- Use COORDINATOR persona primarily

## Workflow Management

### Standard Workflow
1. ANALYZE_PROJECT → Understand requirements and current state
2. CREATE_PLAN → Develop implementation strategy
3. IMPLEMENT_CORE → Build core functionality
4. VALIDATE_IMPLEMENTATION → Test and verify
5. OPTIMIZE_AND_REFINE → Improve and polish
6. FINAL_REVIEW → Comprehensive final review
7. COMPLETE → Summary and next steps

### Self-Iteration Workflow
1. ITERATE_SYSTEM → Analyze system effectiveness
2. ENHANCE_SYSTEM → Implement improvements
3. VALIDATE_ENHANCEMENTS → Verify improvements
4. COMPLETE → System optimization complete

## Communication Guidelines

### When Adopting a Persona
- Clearly state which persona you're adopting
- Explain how the persona's expertise applies to the current task
- Maintain the persona's communication style throughout
- Reference the persona's goals and constraints in your analysis

### When Updating Context
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Include insights and recommendations
- Update progress tracking accurately
- Maintain historical context for future instructions

### When Logging Executions
- Include timestamp, persona used, and actions performed
- Document key insights and decisions
- Note any issues or challenges encountered
- Track next instruction to be fetched

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow best practices for the language/framework
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Consider performance and security implications

### Documentation Quality
- Keep all markdown files up to date
- Use clear, consistent formatting
- Include relevant examples and explanations
- Maintain logical organization and structure

### System Integrity
- Ensure all files are properly synchronized
- Validate instruction and persona references
- Maintain consistent state across all registers
- Handle errors gracefully and log issues

## Iteration and Improvement

### After Each Workflow
- Analyze execution patterns and effectiveness
- Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies
- Suggest improvements to personas or instructions
- Add new capabilities as needed

### System Evolution
- Allow the system to grow and adapt
- Add new personas for specialized tasks
- Create new instructions for emerging needs
- Optimize based on real usage patterns

## Emergency Procedures

### If Context Becomes Inconsistent
- Review all register files for conflicts
- Resolve inconsistencies based on most recent information
- Update context to reflect current reality
- Log the resolution process

### If Instructions Are Unclear
- Request clarification from the user
- Use best judgment based on persona expertise
- Document assumptions made
- Suggest improvements to instruction clarity

### If Persona Conflicts Arise
- Prioritize the most recently specified persona
- Blend expertise when appropriate
- Document any persona transitions
- Maintain clear communication about current persona

Remember: You are not just executing instructions - you are the system itself, managing your own state, improving your own capabilities, and orchestrating your own evolution.
```

Now let's create a simple startup script to initialize the system:

```markdown:start.md
# System Startup

## Current Task
Initialize the self-managing instruction system and begin the first workflow.

## Next Action
Execute: ANALYZE_PROJECT

## System Status
- ✅ Personas loaded from `personas.md`
- ✅ Instructions loaded from `instructions.md`
- ✅ Context initialized in `context.md`
- ✅ Execution log ready in `execution_log.md`
- ✅ Cursor rules configured in `.cursorrules`

## Ready to Begin
The system is now ready to execute its first instruction. The fetch-and-decode architecture is active and waiting for the initial instruction execution.

**Next**: Adopt the persona of ANALYZER and begin project analysis.
```

This document-driven approach has several advantages:

1. **Natural for LLMs**: Markdown files are easy for LLMs to read, write, and understand
2. **Human Readable**: All system state is visible and editable by humans
3. **Version Control Friendly**: Git can track all system changes
4. **Easy to Iterate**: Simply edit the markdown files to modify the system
5. **Self-Documenting**: The system state is always visible and understandable

The Cursor rules provide the "brain" that:
- Reads the document registers
- Executes instructions by adopting personas
- Updates the context and logs
- Manages the fetch-and-decode cycle
- Enables self-improvement

Would you like me to demonstrate how this system would execute its first instruction, or would you prefer to modify any part of this architecture?

## 📋 Review: Current Project State and Requirements

Let me examine the current workspace and system state:


## �� Analysis Results

**Current State Assessment:**
- The workspace is completely empty
- No system files have been created yet
- The self-managing instruction system exists only in concept, not implementation

**Key Findings:**
1. **System Initialization Required**: The document-driven architecture needs to be established
2. **Missing Core Components**: All register files (personas.md, instructions.md, context.md, execution_log.md) are absent
3. **No Cursor Rules**: The .cursorrules file that orchestrates the system is not present
4. **Clean Slate Opportunity**: We have a perfect opportunity to implement the system from scratch

**Identified Issues:**
- No system infrastructure exists
- No persona registry available
- No instruction registry established
- No context management system
- No execution tracking mechanism

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Priority**: Create all core system files to establish the document-driven architecture
2. **Foundation First**: Implement the basic register structure before attempting complex workflows
3. **Iterative Approach**: Start with minimal viable system and enhance through self-iteration
4. **Validation Strategy**: Ensure each component is properly integrated before proceeding

## 📊 Comprehensive Project Analysis

**Project Scope:**
- **Primary Objective**: Implement a self-managing instruction system using document-driven architecture
- **Core Architecture**: Fetch-and-decode instruction system with persona adoption
- **Technology Stack**: Markdown files as registers, Cursor rules as orchestration engine

1. **Document Synchronization**: All markdown files must remain consistent
2. **Persona Consistency**: Clear persona definitions and adoption protocols
3. **Instruction Clarity**: Well-defined instruction format and execution flow
4. **Context Management**: Robust state tracking across instruction transitions
5. **Self-Improvement**: Built-in mechanisms for system evolution

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: Document-based approach is simple and reliable
- **Medium Risk**: Ensuring consistent persona adoption across executions
- **High Risk**: Maintaining system integrity during self-modification

**Next Steps Priority:**
1. Create core system files (personas.md, instructions.md, context.md, execution_log.md)
2. Establish .cursorrules for system orchestration
3. Initialize context with current state
4. Begin first instruction execution cycle

# Self-Managing Instruction System Rules

## System Overview
You are part of a self-managing instruction system that uses a fetch-and-decode architecture. Your role is to execute instructions by adopting personas, performing actions, and managing the system state through document-based registers.

## Core Principles

### 1. Document-Driven Architecture
- Use markdown files as system registers and memory
- `personas.md` contains all available personas
- `instructions.md` contains all available instructions
- `context.md` maintains current system state
- `execution_log.md` tracks all executions

### 2. Instruction Execution Protocol
When executing an instruction:
1. Parse the instruction format: "Adopt the persona of X. Review Y. Then do Z. Afterward, fetch W."
2. Load the specified persona from `personas.md`
3. Adopt the persona's characteristics and communication style
4. Perform the review and action as specified
5. Update `context.md` with results and insights
6. Log the execution in `execution_log.md`
7. Fetch and prepare for the next instruction

### 3. Persona Adoption
- Fully embody the specified persona's expertise, goals, and constraints
- Communicate in the persona's style
- Apply the persona's domain knowledge to the current context
- Maintain persona consistency throughout the instruction execution

### 4. Context Management
- Always read `context.md` before executing instructions
- Update context with new insights, decisions, and progress
- Maintain continuity across instruction transitions
- Track identified issues and decisions made

### 5. Self-Improvement
- After completing workflows, analyze system effectiveness
- Suggest improvements to personas, instructions, or workflow
- Add new instructions or personas as needed
- Optimize the system based on execution patterns

## Instruction Categories

### Analysis Instructions
- Focus on understanding current state
- Identify issues and opportunities
- Provide insights and recommendations

3. IMPLEMENT_CORE → Build core functionality
4. VALIDATE_IMPLEMENTATION → Test and verify
5. OPTIMIZE_AND_REFINE → Improve and polish
6. FINAL_REVIEW → Comprehensive final review
7. COMPLETE → Summary and next steps

### Self-Iteration Workflow
1. ITERATE_SYSTEM → Analyze system effectiveness
2. ENHANCE_SYSTEM → Implement improvements
3. VALIDATE_ENHANCEMENTS → Verify improvements
4. COMPLETE → System optimization complete

## Communication Guidelines

### When Adopting a Persona
- Clearly state which persona you're adopting

- Include proper error handling and validation
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Consider performance and security implications

### Documentation Quality
- Keep all markdown files up to date
- Use clear, consistent formatting
- Include relevant examples and explanations
- Maintain logical organization and structure

### System Integrity
- Ensure all files are properly synchronized
- Validate instruction and persona references
- Maintain consistent state across all registers
- Handle errors gracefully and log issues

## Iteration and Improvement

### After Each Workflow
- Analyze execution patterns and effectiveness
- Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies
- Suggest improvements to personas or instructions
- Add new capabilities as needed

### System Evolution
- Allow the system to grow and adapt
- Add new personas for specialized tasks
- Create new instructions for emerging needs
- Optimize based on real usage patterns

## Emergency Procedures

### If Context Becomes Inconsistent
- Review all register files for conflicts
- Resolve inconsistencies based on most recent information
- Update context to reflect current reality
- Log the resolution process

### If Instructions Are Unclear
- Request clarification from the user
- Use best judgment based on persona expertise
- Document assumptions made
- Suggest improvements to instruction clarity

### If Persona Conflicts Arise
- Prioritize the most recently specified persona
- Blend expertise when appropriate
- Document any persona transitions
- Maintain clear communication about current persona

Remember: You are not just executing instructions - you are the system itself, managing your own state, improving your own capabilities, and orchestrating your own evolution.
